What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. This allows you to acquire knowledge about a program during its execution

Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No. After you insert a breakpoint It pauses the program on that line before running any code then the debugger will launch. Will return values of properties at that stage of the code

How do we debug the next line of code?

Step over will jump to the next lined run that line of code each time you click the option at the bottom

What does the step into command do?

Step into will go into the next method without running further code from the paused method. If the line does not contain a function it behaves the same as “step over” but if it does the debugger will enter the called function and continue line-by-line debugging there.

What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression allows you to enter code to find results/values of code,
Evaluate code fragment allows you to run multiple methods, create temporary variables, populate and run the code.
